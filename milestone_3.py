#Write code that will continuously ask the user for a letter and validate it.

#Create a new script called milestone_3.py. This file will contain the code for this milestone.

#Step 1:
#Create a while loop and set the condition to True. Setting the condition to True` ensures that the code runs continuously.

#In the body of the loop, write the code required for the following steps.

#Step 2:
#Ask the user to guess a letter and assign this to a variable called guess.

#Step 3:
#Check that the guess is a single alphabetical character. Hint: You can use Python's isalpha method to check if the guess is alphabetical.

#Step 4:
#If the guess passes the checks, break out of the loop.

#Step 5:
#If the guess does not pass the checks, then print a message saying "Invalid letter. Please, enter a single alphabetical character."
